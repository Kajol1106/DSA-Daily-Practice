# Three Max, Three Min Please

## Description : 
<p>Given a sorted array of integers, return indices of two numbers such that they add up to a target value.
Print -1 -1 if not found.
  
##### Note - the answer should print the smaller index first followed by the larger index. The smallest such index pair should be printed.

If we have 2 sorted pairs [a1, b1] and [a2, b2], the first pair is said to be smaller than the second one if a1 < a2 or (a1 == a2 and b1 < b2 )
