Brute Force Method : 
======================

It simply means that try out all the alternatives (Possible solution) until you are exhausted of options. 
If the problem is solvable, you will eventually find an answer.

Let us understand it with a very easy example. Suppose you have a locked folder that can be opened by a 5-digit lock 
	code. You have no hint about the lock code, but you just want to see what is behind that lock, what would you do? 
	You would start from 00000 and go all the way to 99999. If the lock is working correctly, one of the combination 
	would definitely open the lock. Although it would take some time, but eventually you would be able to solve the 
	problem.
On the other hand, if you have hints about who owns the folder, or what date was the folder created, you may be able 
	to try out some known combinations first. That could be an optimized approach. Similarly, for problem solving 
	skills in computer science, if a solution to a problem exists, it guaranteed, that you will find it by a brute 
	force method, i.e. applying all the possible combinations.

QUESTION: Given a 3 * 3 grid, you need to fill in numbers from 1-9 such that sum of all diagonals, rows and columns 
		is the same. Also note that none of the numbers should be repeated.

ans. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

We also call it the magic square problem. Now you have to approach this problem in a brute force manner. 
You can start of by trying numbers in any fashion, and keep on verifying the sum in all directions.

Eventually you will reach the correct answer. The sum of every row, column and diagonal is equal to 15 
in this combination of numbers. Because a solution to this problem existed, we were able to find it in a 
brute force manner. But do keep in mind that the brute force method to solve this problem could be very time taking. 
There are a total of 362880 total possible ways to fill up the grid.

Important! Let us try to change the question a little bit. Instead of a 3 * 3 grid, what if you have a 2 * 2 grid? 
You need to fill the grid with numbers 1-4 such that no numbers are repeated. No matter what combination you try, 
you can never reach a condition where the sum of all rows, diagonals and columns is the same.

This means that the solution to this problem does not exist. Hence, even a brute force approach would be unsuccessful.
